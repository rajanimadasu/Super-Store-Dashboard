 In this project, I take a deep dive into the Superstore sales dataset (2014â€“2017) to answer one big question:
   
How can we make smarter decisions to boost profit and growth?

The dataset includes approximately 10,000 transactions with details about products, customers, sales, profit, and shipping.

What did I set out to do?

Spot the patterns: When do customers buy the most? Which months or seasons matter?
Find the winners and losers: Which products, regions, and customers are truly profitable â€” and which are dragging us down?
Dig into the "why": What really drives profit or loss? (Discounts, shipping, geography, or something else?)
Predict the future: Can we build a model that accurately forecasts profit for new orders?
Share clear, practical insights that any manager could act on.

This Superstore dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of total sales by category, features a dynamic line chart displaying annual sales trends with drill-down capabilities into quarters and months for deeper insights, and includes an interactive map for visual exploration of sales performance across countries and states.
